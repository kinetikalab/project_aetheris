# Description

Different designs of discharge chambers:

- `discharge_chambers/surface_barrier_discharge`: Surface barrier discharge with a spiral electrode.
- `discharge_chambers/barrier_discharge`: Classical barrier discharge with a set of rods.
- `discharge_chambers/glinding_arc`: Gliding arc ignition in ejector flow, the most promising option.
