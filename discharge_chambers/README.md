# Description

Different designs of discharge chambers:

- [surface_barrier_discharge](./surface_barrier_discharge/): Surface barrier discharge with a spiral electrode.
- [barrier_discharge](./barrier_discharge/): Classical barrier discharge with a set of rods.
- [glinding_arc](./glinding_arc/): Gliding arc ignition in ejector flow
  
- [3d_rotaing_gliding_arc](./glinding_arc/): **FIRST DRAFT** Gliding arc with magnetic rotation, the most promising option.
  
  A couple of words about the rotating arc. Although the rotation of a discharge arc in a magnetic field is not a novel idea, it is quite a cool concept, and hereâ€™s why. Achieving uniform plasma in a relatively large volume at atmospheric pressure is the Holy Grail of plasma engineering. Despite the fact that we can't ignite plasma throughout the entire volume, we can force the arc to rotate at a relatively high speed (on the order of kilohertz) and ensure uniform radical generation within the entire discharge chamber. Uniform radical generation leads to excellent mixing with contaminated water, resulting in greater purification efficiency.
