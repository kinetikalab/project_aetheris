# Description

Different designs of discharge chambers:

- [surface_barrier_discharge](/surface_barrier_discharge/): Surface barrier discharge with a spiral electrode.
- [barrier_discharge](/barrier_discharge/): Classical barrier discharge with a set of rods.
- [glinding_arc](/glinding_arc/): Gliding arc ignition in ejector flow, the most promising option.
