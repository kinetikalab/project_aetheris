## Gliding Arc 500kHz

**Experimental Setup**

[Pump](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B0DDK7QR6L?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)  
- Flow rate: 10 L/min  
- Pressure: 10 bar  

[Coil](/power_electronics/transformer)  
- Core T60006-L2090-W518
- 3 turns primary winding - litz 3x20x0.2
- 130 turns secondary winding - 0.3 mm Enamelled copper wire
- L1 ~ 190 Î¼H, L2 ~ 190 mH, k > 0.99 (estimate, as it is hard to measure L1/L2 in 500 kHz frequency)
- Cp = 10 pF (measured by 10 points of LC resonaut circuit)
- Cw = 1.6 pF (measured by PeakTech 2170)
- C1 = 22 nF, Cd = 1.6 pF (measured by PeakTech 2170)
