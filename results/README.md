## DBD 50kHZ
We conducted tests on bacterial contaminants using a 4-liter tank with a circulating pump FIP 3200-24 and a discharge chamber at a discharge frequency of approximately 50 kHz. (This frequency corresponds to the previous version of the power electronics; in the next stage, we plan to work at a frequency of 500-1000 kHz).
For the tests, we added a mix of PA, SA, and E. coli bacteria to the water at a concentration of 1000 CFU/ml, thoroughly mixed it, and then activated the [discharge chamber](/discharge_chambers/barrier_discharge).
