<span style="color:red">CURRENT TRANSFORMER DESIGN IS INCORRECT - IDEA OF DECREASING PRIMARY INDUCTANCE WAS WRONG. NEW DESIGN TO BE READY IN MID OF NOV<span>

Design of a high-voltage resonant transformer (L1-L2). See the equivalent circuit diagram in [equivalent_circuit](/power_electronics/equivalent_circuit).

The current coupling coefficient achieved is **k = 0.6**, but with precise assembly and proper selection of magnetic cores, it could exceed **0.9**.

**IMPORTANT:** Epoxy resin casting is **mandatory** to prevent electrical breakdown between the secondary and primary windings, which could result in potential fire hazards.

**IMPORTANT:** Use litz wire for windings, otherwise you can faced with overheating due to skin-effect.

The primary winding is designed as a set of parallel single-spiral coils - that is the main design idea.
